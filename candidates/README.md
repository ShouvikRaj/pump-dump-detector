# Stage 1 candidates

Updated 2026-10-08T02:21:25Z by run `37717415072`. A candidate is a ticker whose Reddit mentions (or hype-language
posts) in the last 24 hours jumped above its prior 7-day mean + 2 sd, with at least
10 mentions from 5 different authors. It stays listed until it goes
24 hours without a new flag. These are statistical flags, not accusations or advice.

Warm-up until 2026-10-12T22:41:09Z: part of the baseline was backfilled from the archive rather than
collected live, so flags in this period are marked `warmup=1` in episodes.csv.
